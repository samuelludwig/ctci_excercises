# ctci_excercises
My work on the practice questions found in CTCI

- I will try to answer each question in at least 3 languages, 5 if I find the time

- I will try to do each in at least C, Java, and Python

- If I can, I would also like to do each one in C# and MIPS Assembly

- Before I answer any question with actual programming I will try to write out very detailed pseudocode
